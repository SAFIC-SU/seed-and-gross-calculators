# Seed Requirement and Gross Margin Calculator App

## Overview

This Streamlit application provides two core functionalities essential for agricultural planning:  
1. ðŸŒ± **Seed Requirement Calculator**: Calculates the seed needed based on user inputs such as area and seed rate.  
2. ðŸ’° **Gross Margin Calculator**: Evaluates costs, revenues, and profits to determine the gross margin for agricultural operations.

## Features
- **Interactive Navigation**:  
  An intuitive navigation bar allows users to switch seamlessly between the calculators.
  
- **Custom Styling and Branding**:  
  Includes custom logos and assets for a professional appearance.

- **Component-based Architecture**:  
  The app is structured using modular components for scalability and maintainability.

## Code Structure
The application is organized into the following directories and files:

## Key Files
- **`app.py`**: Entry point of the application. It initializes the app, renders the navigation bar, and handles page routing.
- **`views/seed.py`**: Implements the UI and logic for the Seed Calculator.
- **`views/margin.py`**: Implements the UI and logic for the Gross Margin Calculator.
- **`config/margin_data.py`** and **`config/seed_data.py`**: Contains data models and constants for calculations.
- **`components/side_margin.py`** and **`components/side_seed.py`**: Sidebar components for respective calculators.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv

   .venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Navigation
- **ðŸŒ± Seed Calculator**: 
  - Input area, seed rate, and other variables to determine seed requirements.
  - Accessed via the "Seed Calculator" button.
